## Missing Features

1. "Address" usage: Etsy, Groupon, and Geek don't have this feature. You can skip it.
2. "Filter" usage: Home, and Wish don't have this feature. You can skip it.
3. "AddCart" and "RemoveCart" usages: 5Miles doesn't have shopping cart, so please use "likes" in 5Miles as the shopping cart, e.g., for the "AddCart" usage, you can add the item to the "likes".


## Changing Apps due to version compatibility
1. Ebay's version is changed (updated the version and used Git LFS to store due to its large size)
2. Google shopping is replaced with Zappos
